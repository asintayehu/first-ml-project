    "    * Encoding the patient demographic: For any outcome or indicator, such as Asthma, COPD, or different types of cancers, a given patients status in relation to some kind of grouping (e.g, Large/Small/Medium Metropolitan Statistical Area, High/Low/Medium Social Vulnerability, etc.) is slightly concerning, as I'm worried that if after cleaning the data, we'll be left with too few data points to make any useful conclusions.\n",
    "    * Will update as I continue to read and analyze data, and narrow the data to form a cogent hypothesis"
